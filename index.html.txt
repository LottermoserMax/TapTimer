	•	Reliability – Review anonymized crash logs (if you opt in to “Share With App Developers” in iOS settings).
4. Data Sharing
We share nothing with third parties, advertising networks, or analytics providers. Health data never leaves your device.
5. Your Controls

9. California Privacy Notice (CCPA)
Tap Timer does not sell personal information. Because we do not maintain user‑identifiable records, requests to access, delete, or opt out of “sale” are not applicable. Uninstalling the app removes any data under our control.
Plain‑English Summary: Tap Timer records timers and (optionally) workouts, stores them privately in iCloud/Health, and never sends them anywhere else. Your data stays yours—full stop.
